1. 100 fish = 1 shoaling (fish get burned)
2. 1 shoaling = 1 daovote
3. 100 shoalings = 1 baracuda (nft) (shoaling gets burned)
4. Max supply = infinate
5. Buytax = 0.5 %
6. Selltax = 1 % 
7. Tax goes towards dao treasury
8. Maximum transactable fish amount = 5 % of circulating supply
9. Minting = double the amount of fish is created, then half is lp paired with the token used to mint and LP is burned, other half gets sent to minter 
10. Flashmint = Flashloan but instead it mints and burns, taking 1 % of the borrowed amount into the dao treasury
11. Dao votes on what token and when to make more LP liquidity to burn with
12. Staking, yieldfold between existing protocols to recieve true yield
